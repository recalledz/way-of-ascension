# Tutorial

The game begins with a short tutorial that guides new players through the basics of cultivation.

1. **Start cultivating** – select the cultivation activity.
2. **Gain foundation** – meditate until your foundation bar rises.
3. **Attempt a breakthrough** – when both Qi and foundation are full, press the breakthrough button.
4. **Reach Qi Refining stage 1** – succeeding marks the tutorial as complete.
