Below are 20 manual concepts designed to fit your cultivation game’s structure and to interact with existing systems such as realms, attributes (Mind, Physique, Agility), laws and weapon proficiency.  These suggestions assume manuals are rare items found in specific adventure zones or earned via sect missions.  Reading a manual queues it for passive learning; early levels take hours, later levels can take days.  Attribute thresholds affect reading speed: for each manual, the **primary attribute** gives the biggest speed reduction, the **secondary attribute** gives a smaller boost.  Manuals can grant new active abilities or passive bonuses, often synergising with laws (e.g., lightning manuals are cheaper if following a lightning law) or proficiencies.
