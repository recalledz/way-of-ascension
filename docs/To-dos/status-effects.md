## **Status Effects (Elemental + Debuffs)**

We tie each effect to **damage type** + **secondary gameplay impact**:

⚖️ **Balance hook**: each element/status gets a **natural counter** (enemies immune or resistant by element). Bosses can have “status thresholds” (e.g. takes 3 stuns → gains temporary stun resist).
