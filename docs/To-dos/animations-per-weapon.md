## Weapon Art & Animations**

* **Differentiate weapons by silhouette + attack rhythm**:

  * Fist → rapid jabs (short arc).
  * Palm → wide flat strikes (pulsing stun wave).
  * Sword → fluid arcs.
  * Spear → thrust with forward lunge.
  * Nunchaku → spinning blur.
  * Chakram → thrown projectile with return arc.
  * Hammer → overhead slam with shockwave.
  * Wand → channel beam / flick.
  * Focus → glowing shield aura.
  * Scepter → heavy swing with elemental burst.

* Animations can be **minimalist flashes/silhouettes** for idle readability (don’t need full character rigs).
