### 🥊 Fist (existing, baseline)

* **Role:** starting unarmed combat; baseline damage, quick attack speed.
* **Scaling:** Balanced across **Physique** and **Mind** (damage and Qi abilities). Proficiency increases basic damage and attack speed.
* **Synergies:** Works well with **body‑tempering manuals** and **qi‑channeling** passives. The “Soul‑Piercing Palm” manual (even though it uses palms) could be repurposed to add special fist abilities.

### ✋ Palm Ability

* **Theme:** Hand abilities focusing on **stuns**, palm strikes and qi‑infused slaps.
* **Combat feel:** Fast, rhythmic strikes; moderate damage; high chance to inflict short‑term stun or disrupt spellcasting.
* **Strengths:** Requires little gear (no weapon dependency), making it ideal for **early game** or resource‑scarce runs.  Good for interrupting tribulation or boss skills.
* **Weaknesses:** Damage falls off in mid/late game without strong manuals or high Physique; stuns often resistible by high‑tier foes.
* **Scaling:** Primarily **Physique** (for damage) and **Mind** (for stun success). **Agility** affects combo speed slightly.
* **Manual ties:** “Soul‑Piercing Palm” from the manual list fits perfectly—levels increase spirit‑penetrating damage and silence chance.  Another manual could be “Hundred‑Palm Frenzy” to unlock long stun chains.
* **Law synergy:** Yin/Yang or Lightning laws enhance stun duration; Earth laws can add knockback.

### 🗡 Sword

* **Theme:** Balanced martial weapon; graceful slashes and thrusts.
* **Combat feel:** Medium attack speed and range; good mix of single‑target and small‑arc AoE.
* **Strengths:** Reliable DPS in all stages; many manuals exist to customise (ice sword, fire blade, lightning thrust).
* **Weaknesses:** Few innate tricks; relies on manuals for unique effects.
* **Scaling:** Even split between **Physique** (raw damage) and **Agility** (attack speed/crit), with **Mind** adding elemental bonuses.
* **Manual ties:** “Sword Intent Chronicle” increases damage and grants *Sword Intent Slash* and later elemental variants. Other manuals might unlock defensive parries or energy waves.
* **Law synergy:** Elemental laws empower sword spells (Flame Sword with fire law, etc.). Sword manuals might require certain proficiency thresholds.

### 🪓 Hammer

* **Theme:** Massive blunt force; crushing blows; crowd control.
* **Combat feel:** **Slow** attack speed but **very high damage** and **large AoE** on impact.
* **Strengths:** High base damage that scales well into late game; strong chance to **stun** and knockback; effective versus heavily armoured foes or groups.
* **Weaknesses:** Slow wind‑up leaves you exposed; needs high **Physique** to wield effectively; poor against nimble enemies.
* **Scaling:** Dominantly **Physique**, with minor **Agility** for recovery time.
* **Manual ties:** “Earth‑Shattering Hammer Manual” increases hammer damage and grants *Seismic Slam*. A second manual could unlock shockwave leaps or spinning swings.
* **Law synergy:** Earth law reduces hammer cooldowns; Lightning law adds chain lightning on impact; Metal law boosts raw damage.
* **Equipment:** Crafting better hammers (using Mining skill) meaningfully improves base damage.

* **Weaknesses:** Provides no raw attack power; must rely on spells or companions for damage.
* **Scaling:** **Mind** for shield strength and Qi regeneration; **Physique** can increase shield capacity; **Agility** helps recharge rate.
* **Manual ties:** “Enlightenment Meditation Sutra” improves Foundation gain and reduces breakthrough backlash — perfect with Focus; an “Qi Shield Manual” could unlock stronger shield layers or reflect damage.
* **Law synergy:** Water law adds regeneration to the shield; Light law increases shield burst on break; Earth law makes shields sturdier.
* **Proficiency:** Increases shield up‑time and reduces Qi‑drain from abilities.

### ⚖️ Spear

* **Theme:** Reach weapon balancing **offense** and **defense**; useful for parrying and thrusting.
* **Combat feel:** Moderate attack speed; long range; some moves create safe distance.

### 🌀 Chakram

* **Theme:** Bladed ring thrown like a boomerang; emphasizes **attack speed** and **critical hits**.
* **Combat feel:** Throws returning blades; mid‑long range; can hit multiple targets on path back.
* **Strengths:** Highest crit multiplier in the game; strong at kiting and hitting multiple enemies; flexible for both single and multi‑target situations.

### 🔮 Wand vs Focus vs Scepter

To differentiate the three spell‑casters:

* **Wand** is a pure damage amplifier for general spells.
* **Focus** is defensive/support, boosting shield and reducing Qi cost.
* **Scepter** is tied to a single element, adding both melee stuns and massive elemental damage to spells.

### ⚙️ Implementation Hooks

1. **Weapon Proficiency:** Each weapon type gets its own proficiency bar.  Using that weapon (or reading its manual) increases proficiency. Higher proficiency improves damage, reduces misfires (nunchaku), or unlocks advanced combos (sword forms, spear parries).
2. **Manual & Law Integration:** Manuals unlock or enhance weapon‑specific skills.  Laws act as multipliers or open hidden chapters of those manuals.  For example, the “Dragon Spear Manual” has extra chapters for players following a Water law.
3. **Attribute Weighting:** As you suggested, Mind alone shouldn’t drive reading speed or weapon power.  Each weapon has its own primary and secondary attributes.  Players are rewarded for building Physique and Agility as appropriate.
4. **Tiered Gear:** Low‑tier weapons drop in early zones and suit early manuals; mid‑ and high‑tier versions appear in later zones, requiring higher realm or sect upgrades to use.
5. **Reincarnation/Prestige:** Weapon proficiency resets on reincarnation but grants a small carry‑over multiplier (e.g. 5 % of proficiency converts to a permanent crit bonus for that weapon type).  This encourages experimentation across runs.

These design notes should help you shape a cohesive and balanced weapon system that complements cultivation, manuals, laws and proficiency rather than overwhelming them.
