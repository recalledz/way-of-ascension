## **Crafting / Forging**

* **Materials**: Ore (metal/earth), Herbs (wood/poison), Monster Essences (status), Special Drops (boss).
* **Process**:

  1. Gather mats via disciples’ tasks (mining, hunting, cooking).
  2. Forge at sect forge.
  3. Random roll quality/tier, but player can *temper* with Qi to reroll or boost stats.
* **Interactions**: Forged gear can gain elemental affinity (e.g. Fire-forged sword burns).
* **Upgrading**: Old gear can be refined with new mats, preserving affixes → keeps progression smooth.
