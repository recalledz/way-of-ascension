## 🔄 Stat Interactions
- **Accuracy vs Dodge**: `hitChance = Math.max(0.05, attacker.accuracy - target.dodge)`
- **Armor Mitigation**: Physical damage reduction based on defense
- **Status Effects**: Chance to apply based on attacker's stats vs target's resistances

## 📊 Scaling Factors
- Primary attributes (Physique, Mind, Agility, etc.) affect different stats
- Equipment and manuals provide flat or percentage bonuses
- Some stats have diminishing returns at higher values
