# Weapon Proficiency

Each weapon type tracks its own proficiency. Landing an attack grants experience based on the foe's durability:

- **XP gain** = ceil(enemy max HP / 30) per successful attack.
- **Level requirement** = 100 XP per proficiency level.
- **Rewards per level**: +1 flat damage and +1% attack speed with that weapon.

This scaling lets lowâ€‘tier enemies like Forest Rabbits award around 2 XP per hit for quick early progression while still rewarding tougher foes.
